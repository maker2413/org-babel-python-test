Jupyter Notebooks are pretty cool, but doing stuff in emacs is better and
org-mode might as well be the best writing tool ever created.

I'm using this repository as a place to test the capabilities and functionality
of org-mode with regards to python development. I'm hoping to axe Jupyter out of
my life. A lot of this is taken from this site:
https://michaelneuper.com/posts/replace-jupyter-notebook-with-emacs-org-mode/

With that out of the way let's begin playing around:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports none
  ;; This will make org-babel use the .venv directory in this repo
  (setq org-babel-python-command (concat
                                  (file-name-directory (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name)))
                                  ".venv/bin/python"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: /home/epost/Code/org-jupyter/.venv/bin/python

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session foo :results output :exports both
  a = 27
  print(a)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 27

#+begin_src python :results output raw drawer
  b = 21
  print(b)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
21
:end:

#+begin_src python :results output raw :exports both
  print("Hello, Emacs Org Mode!")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
Hello, Emacs Org Mode!
